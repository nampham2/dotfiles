# Plan Implementation

## Requirement:
  - Implement tasks from a plan documented in a document following the steps described below.

## Step 1: Locate the Plan
Use git commands to locate the plan in docs/plans/. Plans are typically recent markdown files in the current branch.
Please use your best effort to guess the plan name and ask me to confirm if it is correct.

<ask_followup_question>
<question>What is the name of the plan to implement?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

## Step 2: Understand the Implementation Plan
Read the plan carefully. Review the memory bank, codebase, and documentation.
YOU MUST cross check the plan with the code base, use sequential thinking tool if needed.
Always stop ask clarifying questions before implementing the plan.

## Step 3: Determine Implementation Scope
Check the codebase for already-implemented tasks and existing implementation summaries. Read these first, then identify remaining work.

<ask_followup_question>
<question>Which tasks should I implement?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

## Step 4: Execute Implementation
Implement the specified tasks, do the each task with a fresh eye.
Ask questions when unclear. DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THE PLAN.

## Step 5: Write a implementation summary
Briefly present me the results of the implementation, focus on
the decisions made, the deviations in bite size paragraphs.

Then ask me if you should write a implementation summary.
The summary should be in a markdown file with the same name as the plan
but with a `_impl_summary` suffix.
