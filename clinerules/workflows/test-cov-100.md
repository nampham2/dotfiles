# Write tests to get 100% test coverage

## Requirement:
  - Write tests to achieve 100% test coverage, you have to follow the steps described below.
  - ONLY tests should be written or modified, NOT the source code
  - YOU MUST STOP and ASK if you want to modify source code
  - YOU MUST STOP and ASK if a bug in the source code is probable and you want to fix it before moving on
  - ALWAYS start with writting tests for higher level classes and then lower level classes.
  - YOU MUST follow the steps described below.

## Step 1: Making sure the git-tree is clean
Check the current git branch: 
  - If the current git tree is not clean, **ask me to clean up the git tree and return to the master branch**. Repeat checking until the git is on master branch and clean.
  - If on the master branch, create a new branch with a descriptive name. Consider whether to commit current changes before proceeding.

    <ask_followup_question>
    <question>Which git branch should I create?</question>
    </ask_followup_question>

  - Check out the branch with the branch name obtained above.

## Step 2: Read the code base
NOTE: Ask me to switch to `Act mode` before proceed.

Figure out which tests need to be covered by running tests with coverage option.
Then read the code base, memory bank, docs to 
better understand the tests to be written, use the **sequential thinking** tool if needed.
Stop and present to me a brief plan to achieve 100% test coverage.
Ask questions if you have before proceed

YOU MUST stop and present to me a brief plan to fix all the tests.

## Step 3: Write the tests
YOU MUST read the `Requirement` section again and follow it strictly.
Write the tests, adhere to the plan and the *requirements* in the first sections.
After you are done, STOP and show me a short summary of what you did, especially your decisions
and what deviated from the plan if there are any.
