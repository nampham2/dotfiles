# Plan Implementation Review

An engineer has implemented tasks from the plan. Review the implementation for adherence to the plan.

## Step 1: Locate the Plan
Use git commands to locate the plan in docs/plans/. Plans are typically recent markdown files in the current branch.

<question>What is the name of the plan to review?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

## Step 2: Understand the Implementation Plan
Read the plan carefully. Review the memory bank, codebase, and documentation. Ask clarifying questions as needed.

## Step 3: Identify Completed Tasks
Determine which tasks have been implemented and require review. If tasks are grouped in phases, identify which groups are complete.

<question>Which tasks have been implemented and need review?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

## Step 4: Review the Work
Use your best effort to look for implementation summaries in the docs folder.
The summaries usually have the same name as the plan and with `_impl_summary` suffix.
Review the implementation thoroughly. Use sequential thinking tools as needed. Present your analysis in 200-300 word sections, confirming understanding after each section.

## Step 5: Write Implementation Feedback (Optional)
Ask whether implementation feedback should be documented. Determine the appropriate filename (same folder as related docs). Write constructive feedback if requested.
