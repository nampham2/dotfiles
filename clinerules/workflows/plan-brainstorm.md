# Idea Brainstorming

Help me develop an idea into a complete design and implementation plan.

## Step 1: Gather Background Information
Review the memory bank and current project state to understand the starting point. Then ask clarifying questions one at a time. Use multiple-choice questions when possible, but open-ended questions are acceptable.

## Step 2: Define the Topic
Ask for the brainstorming topic and gather clarification through targeted questions. For topics involving code changes, confirm whether backward compatibility is required.

<question>What is the topic for brainstorming?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

## Step 3: Design Development
  - Understand the topic thoroughly through questions. Once ready, present the design in sections of 200-300 words, confirming accuracy after each section.
  - Please read the rules under `.clinerules` for best coding and testing practices.
  - YOU MUST ALWAYS cross check your code and test ideas with the real code. No discrepancies between new code and tests with the current one
    are allowed.
